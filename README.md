## 👥 Team Information

| Member | Assigned roles | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mlaurent` | Backend Lead, Architect | Backend architecture, Socket.IO integration |
| `jdu` | Frontend Lead | Frontend architecture, UI implementation, and user flows |
| `lifan` | Product Owner, Database Lead | Backlog priorities, database schema, Prisma integration, database APIs, and documentation |
| `yren` | Project Manager, Frontend Developer | Meetings, task coordination, frontend development, authentication, and internationalization |
| `gustgonz` | Security Lead, DevSecOps | WAF, Vault, Docker infrastructure, security testing, and Socket.IO support |

## 🗂️ Project Management

- **Work organization:** The team first held weekly meetings, then formed
  smaller groups around frontend, backend, database, security, and real-time
  features.
- **Task distribution:** Tasks were assigned according to each member's main
  role and adjusted during team meetings when dependencies or blockers appeared.
- **Management tools:** Notion was used for planning and documentation. GitHub
  was used for source control, branches, reviews, and issue tracking.
- **Communication:** Discord and WeChat were used for daily discussion,
  technical questions, and meeting organization.

## 🧰 Technical Stack

| Area | Technologies | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript | Component-based UI, routing, server rendering, and type safety |
| Styling | CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS | Local component styles and rapid responsive layout |
| Backend | Next.js Route Handlers, Node.js | Keeps the frontend and HTTP APIs in one TypeScript application |
| Authentication | NextAuth, credentials, Google OAuth, 42 OAuth | Supports local and external authentication providers |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 | Reliable relational storage with transactions and constraints |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe queries, migrations, relations, and seed support |
| Real-time layer | Socket.IO | Bidirectional events for chat, presence, invitations, and games |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose or Podman Compose | Reproducible development and production environments |
| Security | ModSecurity, OWASP CRS, HashiCorp Vault, HTTPS | Request filtering and centralized secret management |

PostgreSQL was chosen because the application contains highly interconnected data:
users, friendships, conversations, messages, learning progress, invitations,
rooms, and game sessions. Foreign keys, unique constraints, and transactions
help keep this data consistent.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Development

```text
Browser
  |-- HTTP ----------> Next.js :3000
  |-- Socket.IO -----> ws-server :3001
                         |
Next.js ----------------+-------> PostgreSQL :5432
```

### Production

```text
Browser
   |
HTTPS
   v
WAF / ModSecurity
   |-- HTTP -------> Next.js
   |-- Socket.IO -> ws-server
                         |
Next.js ----------------+-------> PostgreSQL
   |
   +----------------------------> HashiCorp Vault
```

The WAF is the public production entry point. Vault initializes and stores the
database, authentication, and OAuth secrets.
See [CYBERSECURITY.md](CYBERSECURITY.md) for the security module architecture.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The database schema is defined with Prisma in
[`Echo_of_Morse/prisma/schema.prisma`](Echo_of_Morse/prisma/schema.prisma).

### Relationship Overview

```text
User
 |-- Account / Session
 |-- Friendship <--------------------------> User
 |-- Conversation --> Message -------------> User
 |-- SystemMessage
 |-- UserLetterProgress --------------------> Letter
 |-- GameInvitation ------------------------> User
 |                         |

## 🔁 Feature Flow Summary

This section summarizes the main runtime flows. The common pattern is:
frontend action -> authenticated Next.js API -> Prisma/PostgreSQL write ->
optional Socket.IO signal -> frontend GETs latest authorized state.

### 1. Profile and Login

- Register: form -> validation -> bcrypt hash -> `User`.
- Credentials login: form -> NextAuth -> DB lookup -> bcrypt compare ->
  JWT session with `user.id`.
- OAuth: Google/42 -> NextAuth callback -> account check/link -> `Account`.
- Profile read: `/api/users/[id]` -> session check -> user/stats/friends.
- Profile update: edit form -> owner check -> validation -> `User` update.
- Online state: Socket.IO JWT from NextAuth session -> ws-server verifies ->
  status API -> `isOnline`, `lastSeen`.


### 2. Learning

- Level practice: level config -> mixed encode/decode questions -> answers ->
  `/api/learning/practice-result`.
- Pass rule: `correctCount >= passCount` -> `learningLevel + 1`,
  `practiceSessions + 1`.
- SRS correct: `mastery + 1`, larger `interval`, higher `easeFactor`,
  new `nextReviewAt`.
- SRS wrong: `mastery - 1`, `interval = 1 day`, lower `easeFactor`,
  new `nextReviewAt`.
- Review selection: seen chars -> due first -> low mastery -> low accuracy ->
  older `nextReviewAt` -> 20 questions.
- Review saving: raw answers -> server-side Morse check -> group by char ->
  counters per answer, SRS once per char.
- Progress display: aggregate `correctCount / totalSeen` -> accuracy card,
  weak chars, level board, per-letter bar chart.

### 3. Chat

- Friend request: search -> POST `/api/friends` -> `PENDING` -> accept/reject
  -> `ACCEPTED` or delete.
- Conversation load: `/api/conversations` + `/api/messages` -> membership
  check -> ordered history.
- Message transform: mode -> text/Morse helpers -> invalid Morse rejected.
- Message send: POST `/api/messages` -> membership check -> `Message` ->
  `chat:message:new`.
- Notifications: socket signal -> GET `/api/notifications` or messages -> DB
  truth.
- Chat game invite: friend/lobby/state checks -> `GameInvitation` +
  `SystemMessage` -> Socket.IO target notify.

### 4. Competition

- Overview: `RadioRoom` + lobby counts + online users -> live counts.
- Join lobby: POST radio -> session/capacity/state checks ->
  `RadioLobbyPresence` -> `radio:user-list-updated`.
- Ready: PATCH ready -> presence status + ready queue transaction ->
  `radio:ready-list-updated`.
- Start match: FIFO ready players -> session + player rows -> `PLAYING` ->
  clear queue -> `radio:game-created`.
- Session GET: participant check -> deterministic word list -> current user as
  `id: "me"`.
- Score correct: one attempt per sequence -> `correct + 1`, `total + 1`,
  answer-length points + speed bonus + streak.
- Score wrong: first clear mistake -> `total + 1`, streak reset, no score loss.
- Accuracy: `correct / total`; empty input and valid prefixes do not count.
- Live ranking: PATCH monotonic progress -> `RadioSessionPlayer` ->
  `game:session-updated` -> GET latest state.
- Finish/abandon: final PATCH -> completed/abandoned flags -> all done or one
  active left -> `FINISHED`, lobby back to `IDLE`.

**Implemented raw total: 23 points.**

### Custom Module Justification: Morse Learning Engine

We chose this custom module because Morse learning is central to the project,
not a side feature. It gives users a complete training loop before they use
Morse in chat or multiplayer radio sessions.

The module includes a 12-level curriculum, mixed encode/decode practice,
browser Morse audio playback, server-side answer validation, per-character
progress tracking, weak-character detection, and adaptive spaced repetition
using `mastery`, `interval`, `easeFactor`, and `nextReviewAt`.

It deserves Major module status because it is a project-specific subsystem with
its own data model, learning algorithm, interactive UI, API routes, audio
behavior, and persistent progress logic.

### Candidate Evidence, Not Counted Conservatively

| Possible module | Evidence | Why not added to confirmed total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Advanced analytics dashboard with data visualization | Learning dashboard: global accuracy, practice sessions, level progression board, weak-character detection, per-letter accuracy bar chart sorted from weakest to strongest | Useful learning analytics, but not counted because it does not provide the full major-module scope such as export functionality, customizable date ranges, and dashboard-level filters |

## 🚀 Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker with Docker Compose, or Podman with `podman-compose`
- GNU Make
- OpenSSL for the production self-signed certificate
- Git

Node.js, npm, and PostgreSQL do not need to be installed on the host because
they run inside containers.

### Environment Configuration

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Transcendence/Echo_of_Morse
cp .env.example .env
```

Complete these variables in `.env`:

- `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`
- Google and 42 OAuth client IDs and secrets when OAuth is enabled

For development, use the database service name inside Docker:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@db:5432/DATABASE
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

A secret can be generated with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Run the Development Environment

```bash
make dev
```

The development entry point generates the Prisma client, applies migrations,
seeds the database, and starts the services.

- Web application: `http://localhost:3000`
- Socket.IO server: `http://localhost:3001`

Useful commands:

```bash
make dev-logs    # Run development services and display logs
make down        # Stop development services
make rebuild     # Rebuild and restart development services
make db-init     # Apply migrations and run the seed
make typecheck   # Run the TypeScript type check in Docker
make lint        # Run ESLint in Docker
make check       # Run typecheck and lint
```

### Reset the Development Database

```bash
make reset-db
make dev
make db-init
```

`make reset-db` removes the local development database volume.

### Run the Production Environment

```bash
make prod
```

This generates a self-signed certificate and starts the WAF, Next.js
application, Socket.IO server, PostgreSQL, and Vault services.

Production entry point: `https://localhost:8443`

See [MAKEGUIDE.md](MAKEGUIDE.md) for the complete command reference.

## 🧪 Initial Test Data

The development initialization runs `prisma/seed.js`. It creates test data so
that the main user, learning, chat, and competition flows can be tested immediately.
These credentials are for local development only.

### Test Accounts

All seeded accounts use the password `MorseTest123!`. If the database already
contains seed data, running the seed again updates these known test accounts to
that password without deleting existing local data.

| Username | Email | Level | Purpose |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `lifan` | `lifan@test.com` | 3 | General testing |
| `yren` | `yren@test.com` | 4 | General testing |
| `jdu` | `jdu@test.com` | 2 | General testing |
| `mlaurent` | `mlaurent@test.com` | 5 | General testing |
| `gustgonz` | `gustgonz@test.com` | 3 | General testing |
| `nobody` | `nobody@test.com` | 1 | Account outside the seeded friend group |
| `top_student` | `top_student@test.com` | 12 | Advanced progress testing |
| `learner` | `learner@test.com` | 1 | Learning and review testing |

### Competition Test Set

The seed creates three radio rooms for competition testing:

| Radio | Name | Speed | Purpose |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `01` | `Radio Wave 01` | 5 WPM | Slower multiplayer decoding |
| `02` | `Radio Wave 02` | 10 WPM | Intermediate multiplayer decoding |
| `03` | `Radio Wave 03` | 15 WPM | Faster multiplayer decoding |

Game sessions use a deterministic shuffle of the following word bank. Each
session selects 12 words from this list based on the session id, so the order
can change between sessions but the valid answers are always from this set.

| Answer | Morse prompt |
| --- | --- |
| `HELLO` | `.... . .-.. .-.. ---` |
| `WORLD` | `.-- --- .-. .-.. -..` |
| `MORSE` | `-- --- .-. ... .` |
| `CODE` | `-.-. --- -.. .` |
| `RADIO` | `.-. .- -.. .. ---` |
| `SIGNAL` | `... .. --. -. .- .-..` |
| `READY` | `.-. . .- -.. -.--` |
| `WAVE` | `.-- .- ...- .` |
| `LEARN` | `.-.. . .- .-. -.` |
| `LISTEN` | `.-.. .. ... - . -.` |
| `DECODE` | `-.. . -.-. --- -.. .` |
| `MESSAGE` | `-- . ... ... .- --. .` |
| `FRIEND` | `..-. .-. .. . -. -..` |
| `QUICK` | `--.- ..- .. -.-. -.-` |
| `FOCUS` | `..-. --- -.-. ..- ...` |
| `TRANSMIT` | `- .-. .- -. ... -- .. -` |

### Test Scripts

The repository includes a concurrent-user regression test for the competition
flow:

```bash
cd Echo_of_Morse
make test
```

It creates independent temporary users, logs them in, opens real WebSocket
connections through the WAF, joins the same radio lobby, marks all users ready,
creates a game session, submits concurrent score updates, completes the
session, and checks that socket events were received.

To clear only transient radio test state:

```bash
make test-clean
```

Equivalent clean test sequence:

```bash
make clean test
```

### Seeded Content

- `lifan`, `yren`, `jdu`, `mlaurent`, and `gustgonz` are accepted friends.
- `lifan` and `yren` have a conversation with example messages.
- `lifan` and `jdu` have an empty conversation.
- Supported Morse characters are inserted into `Letter`.
- `learner` receives randomized normal learning progress.
- `top_student` receives randomized high-mastery progress.
- Three radio rooms are created at 5, 10, and 15 WPM.

The seed is designed to avoid duplicate users. Randomized learning counters may
change after a database reset.
